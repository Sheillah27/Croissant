      A croissant is a flaky, crescent-shaped pastry renowned for its buttery
      taste. Originating from Vienna, Austria, the croissant gained fame in
      France. Legend has it that bakers in Vienna alerted the army during the
      "Battle of Vienna" in 1683 by creating a pastry resembling the Ottoman
      Empire's crescent symbol. The technique of layering butter within the
      dough, known as laminating, was used, resulting in the croissant's
      signature light and airy texture. Over time, the croissant became an
      integral part of French cuisine and has since become a beloved breakfast
      or snack worldwide, available in a variety of sweet and savory fillings.
